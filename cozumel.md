---

## 📍 The Strategy
To find the real town, walk **perpendicular to the ocean** (inland) for at least 3-5 blocks. Your MSC ship docks at **Punta Langosta**, which puts you right at the edge of the historic center.

---

## 🍴 Authentic Local Food
Skip the port-side chains. These spots are verified active for 2026:

### 1. Mercado Municipal (The Local Market)
This is where the island eats. Walk to the back of the market to find the *loncherias* (food stalls).
* **Order:** *Cochinita Pibil* (slow-roasted pork) or *Panuchos*.
* **Location:** Corner of **Adolfo Rosado Salas** and **25th Ave**.
* **Vibe:** Bustling, local, and incredibly cheap.

### 2. Taqueria El Mexicano
A no-frills, high-quality spot famous for its *Al Pastor*.
* **Location:** **10th Ave Sur** (between Calle Salas and Calle 3).
* **Vibe:** Plastic chairs, cold beer, and the best tacos in the area.

### 3. La Choza
A local institution for sit-down regional Mexican cuisine. 
* **Order:** *Sopa de Lima* (Lime Soup) or *Pollo Pibil*.
* **Location:** **10th Ave and Calle Salas**.

## 🍺 Local Beer & Music

### Cervecería Punta Sur
The first and best microbrewery on the island.
* **The Beer:** Fresh IPAs and fruit-infused ales brewed on-site.
* **The Food:** Excellent wood-fired pizza if you need a break from Mexican fare.
* **Location:** **10th Ave Sur** (between Calle 3 and 5).

### Woody’s Bar and Grill
One of the few spots near the center that consistently hosts **daytime live music** (often Latin duos or acoustic performers).
* **Location:** On the main square (**Juarez Park**).

## 🛍️ Real Shops (No Haggling)

* **Chocolatería Isla Bella:** A family-run bean-to-bar chocolate shop. You can see them grinding the cacao. 
    * *Location: Calle 3 Sur (near 5th Ave).*
* **Los Cinco Soles:** High-end Mexican crafts, vanilla, and silver in a beautiful historic building. No high-pressure sales.
    * *Location: North end of the waterfront (Rafael Melgar).*
* **Mayaluum:** Authentic Mayan hammocks and hand-woven textiles.
    * *Location: 5th Ave (between Calle 2 and 4).*

## 🚶 Suggested Walking Loop
1. **The Inland Push:** Exit the pier and walk 3 blocks inland to **10th Avenue**.
2. **The Market:** Head south to the **Mercado Municipal** for a cheap, authentic lunch.
3. **The Refreshment:** Walk back north on 10th Ave to **Cervecería Punta Sur** for a local craft pint.
4. **The Culture:** Head to the **Zócalo (Main Square)** to see the local clock tower and grab a chocolate at **Isla Bella**.
5. **The Return:** Walk the waterfront (The Malecón) back to the ship as the sun sets.

> **Pro Tip:** While most places near the pier take USD, the inland spots and the Mercado vastly prefer **Mexican Pesos**. You will get a much better value using local currency.
